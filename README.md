# Countdown Timer Project

This project is a visually appealing countdown timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer dynamically counts down to a target date and time, updating in real-time.

---

## Project Overview
The countdown timer displays the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds remaining until a specified target date. The design uses a clean and modern aesthetic with a background image and centralized timer elements.

---

## Features
- **Dynamic Countdown**:
  - Automatically updates every second to display the time remaining.
- **Responsive Design**:
  - The layout is designed to remain visually appealing on different screen sizes.
- **Customizable Target Date**:
  - The target date can be easily modified in the JavaScript code.

---

## File Structure
### HTML (`index.html`):
- Defines the structure of the webpage, including:
  - Title (`<h1>`): "Until new beginnings".
  - Countdown container with separate elements for days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Links the CSS and JavaScript files.

### CSS (`styles.css`):
- **Styling**:
  - Uses the "DM Sans" font for a clean look.
  - Implements a full-screen background image sourced from Unsplash.
  - Centers the content both vertically and horizontally.
  - Styles the countdown numbers and labels (e.g., "days", "hours").
- **Key Features**:
  - Fixed position for the heading.
  - Flexbox for aligning the countdown elements.

### JavaScript (`script.js`):
- **Countdown Logic**:
  - Calculates the remaining time until the target date.
  - Updates the DOM elements (`days`, `hours`, `minutes`, `seconds`) every second using `setInterval`.
  - Converts milliseconds into days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Target Date**:
  - Predefined as "9 Feb 2025" but can be changed easily by modifying the `target` variable.
